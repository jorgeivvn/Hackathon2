# Unnamed Map Project

## Mission Statement
Unnamed Map Project lets you and your network annotate your world. Login to view your map groups. Add a pin to one of your groupsâ€™ map with a brief description and comments. Imagine a group of incoming freshmen exploring Austin for the first time. Using Unnamed Map Project, they can create a closed group to pin and comment on locations worth sharing.

## Platform:
When a user signs in, they will have a map, and a sidebar with groups. The user will be able to add a pin to the map of a place they have visited. The user will then be able to add comments/thoughts on that place they pinned on the map. Users will be able to edit, add, and delete to their comments/thoughts. User will also be able to create different groups with different members/friends/users.
